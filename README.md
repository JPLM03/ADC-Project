# CDA Group 12

- The analysis file
\ Has a simple aproach and was mainly used to print graphs useful to the report, therefore we considered it important to include it in the repository, as it has proof of the work done.
- The Movies_CDA file
\ Was used to work the data more profoundly specifically to produce the relationship graphs and apply algorithms we learnt in class.
